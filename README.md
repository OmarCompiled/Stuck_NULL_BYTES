**About the Game:**  
> A **fast-paced horror roguelite** where you relive childhood nightmares, fight shadows, and collect memory shards to survive.

STUCK is a looping nightmare roguelite where speed and nerves matter.  
You play as **James**, trapped between life and a coma, reliving childhood trauma while hostile shadows stalk every corridor.  
Defeat shadows, collect **memory shards**, and unlock upgrades to survive the next run.  
Each attempt brings you closer to the truth… or deeper into the dark.

## Backstory
James’s body lies broken in a hospital bed, his mind trapped in endless nightmares that fold and repeat.  
Each nightmare reflects a buried fear or trauma from his childhood.  
Fragments of memory appear as shards, battered pieces of who he was.  
The shadows that stalk him are those traumas given form. Only by confronting them and gathering memory can James hope to wake.

4. Collect shards

- **Nightmares built on fear** with levels inspired by phobias and childhood trauma.  
- **Procedurally varied rooms** that remix every nightmare for replayability.

## Tips
- Your sanity drains over time. Kill shadows to restore it.  
- Look for healing rooms. They give back some sanity when you are low.  
- Dodge dashing shadows. They hit harder than the rest.  
- Collect shards whenever possible. They make you stronger for the next run.
